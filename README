These are base versions of dotfiles.  To "install" them, run the 
install-dotlinks script in this directory.

Those files that have the .base extension should somehow be sourced from your
existing dot files.  e.g., in your .cshrc:

source .cshrc.base

There are also scripts in bin-shared that will be linked to ~/bin/shared, which 
will be referenced in your path by .[zc]shrc.base
